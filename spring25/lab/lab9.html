<h2>Linear Search</h2>

<p>A brute force way to find something in a list of items is to start at the beginning, and look at each one until the item is located.  Or until you have looked at everything and determined it's not in the list.  This approach is called <b>linear search</b> or <b>sequential search</b>.  Work through the textbook section, thinking about the running time of the algorithm:</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Binary Search</h2>

<p>If your list of items has some order, then you can be much more efficient about searching for items.  The standard approach is called <b>binary search</b>.  Work through the textbook section, thinking about the running time of the algorithm:</p>

<p>Lets consider a variation:  finding something in a sorted listed that has been rotated:</p>

<h2>Hashing as Searching</h2>

<p>The chapter ends with hashing as searching:</p>

<br><br>


<h2>Quizzes and Code Reviews</h2>

There are weekly written quizzes and code reviews in 1001G, 11:30-5:30, Mondays-Fridays when classes are in session.  No appointments are needed for CSCI 227 students. 


<h2>Additional Practice</h2>

<p>For additional practice on core Python, see the HackerRank prepare series:</p>


<blockquote><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python">HackerRank:  Prepare  Python</a></blockquote>

<p>
Click the <code class="inline">Medium</code> option on the right hand menu, and work through their Python challenges.
</p>

<p>For more practice on searching techniques to solve problems, here are some popular ones from LeetCode:</p>
