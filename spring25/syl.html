<p>
<b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i> This course focuses on the program design process and practical programming skills, building on the previous programming experience from CSCI 127.  Material will focus on more advanced topics such as structures for efficiently storing, sorting and accessing data, recursion, and code reuse.  Program development and maintenance skills including debugging, testing, and documentation will also be taught. <br>
There is no formal writing requirement for this course.
<br><b>Prerequisites: </b> CSci 127.
<br><b>Instructors:</b> Lola Samigjonova, Adjunct Lecturer
<br><b>Course Email:</b> zs494@hunter.cuny.edu.
<br><b>Meetings:</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>Lecture:  Wednesdays, 10:00am-11:15am: in-person,</li>
    <li>Quizzes & Code Reviews, 1001G: in-person, and</li>
    <li>Lab Exercices:  on-line.</li>
  </ul> 
<br>


<h2>Grading Policy</h2>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.</p>

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught as a blend of in-person meetings and as well as online activities. Each week the course meets:
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 hours of synchronous, in-person lecture,</li>
    <li>0.5 hours of in-person assessments, and</li>
    <li>1.0 hours of Online Labs to be completed by the students independently (links to the labs can be found <a href="work.html">Coursework Page</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
 

<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b>
 At every lecture, there will be a paper lecture slip to be submitted. Completed lecture slips are given full credit. Turning in lecture slips will only help your grade. There are no make-ups for lecture slips. Instead, the grade you earn on the final exam replaces any missing or low lecture slip when computing the final grade.
</p>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b>
Every week, there will be a quiz to be taken in 1001G HN, on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and programming assignments.
<ul>
  <li>As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
  </li>
  <li>Quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and the first pass of many programming job interviews).</li>
  <li>For the quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).</li>
  <li><b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b> Instead, the 10 highest quiz scores  are used when computing the final grade.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Code Reviews:</b>
  Every week, there will be an in-person code review on the recently submitted programs.
  <ul>
    <li>For each code review, you choose one of the listed programs to explain on the whiteboard.</li>
    <li>Code reviews are on the whiteboard (echoing the style of many programming job interviews).</li>
    <li>All code reviews must be taken by the deadline.</li>
    <li><b>There are no make-up code reviews.</b> Instead, the 10 highest code review scores are used when computing the final grade.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Weekly Online Lab:</b> Each week, you are expected to work through the associated Online Lab. These are available on the course webpage (you will need a computer with Python 3.6. See the first lab for installation instructions). Laptops will also be available in 1001G HN with all required software.</p>

<p><b>Homework: </b> Programming exercises are posted on the class website, usually three weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab. Note that as the semester progresses, the programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to complete. You should plan to spend approximately 3 hours per week on programming exercises. To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted by 5pm on the due date. 

<p>While every 3 programs should be worked on the week of the corresponding lab, due dates are staggered to provide flexibility (should you be unable to work for a few days you need not miss the deadline). Students who work on the programming assignments the week of the corresponding lab tend to have greater success in the course. </p>

<p>
Programs are submitted via gradescope. You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores). No late homework is accepted.</p>

<p><b>Final Exam:</b>
  <p>The final exam is required. It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  Sample exams will be available on the course webpage. 
    You must take and pass the final (60 points or more) to pass the course.</p>
    

<p><b>Grades:</b>
  The grading for the course will be based on:
  <ul>
    <li>Programming Assignments: 20% (average, after 5 lowest scores are dropped).</li>
    <li>Lab Quizzes:  20% (the average of the highest 10 quiz scores).</li>
    <li>Code Reviews: 20% (the average of the highest 10 code review scores).</li>
    <li>Participation: 10% (your grade on the final will replace the grades for missing lecture slips).</li>
    <li>Final Exam: 30%.</li>
  </ul>
 

 </p>


<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.
As a general rule, do your own typing. Submitting work of others, or not safeguarding your work from copying, are academic integrity violations.
You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

<p><b>Emergencies:</b> 
We understand that emergencies happen during the term, and as such, we
  <ul>
      <li> Drop the lowest programming grades,
      <li> Drop the lowest quizzes and code review grades, and
      <li> Replace low or missing classwork participation with the written exam grade.
  </ul>
See individual sections above for details.  <b>To respect your privacy, there is no need to provide documentation to take advantage of the dropping/replacing grades above.</b>  It is done automatically.  If you are going to miss more than 2 weeks of class and associated work, contact us, so we can make arrangements for you to take the course in a future term.

<a href="https://ww2.hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-life/emergency-support-and-resources">Student Life's Support & Resources Page</a>.
University computer laboratories are available for this course in 1001G HN. These machines are for all students enrolled in a computer science at Hunter College.  Given the limited number, work on those computers must be related to this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term.


<p>
  <b>Tutoring:</b> The college provides drop-in tutoring and assistance for courses in 1001G Hunter North.  By appointment and drop-in tutoring is available from 11:30am-5pm Mondays to Fridays.
We also provide discussion board and email help.  More information is available on the course site on Blackboard.  
</p>

<p><b>Policy on Bullying:</b>  Bullying, cyberbullying, online hate, intimidation, threats, harassment, and pressure to share schoolwork are all forms of violence. CUNY holds a zero tolerance stance towards all such acts. The University is committed to prevention of any form of bullying, will respond promptly to threats and/or acts, and will protect victims of bullying from retaliation.  As a criminal matter, the New York Attorney General defines cyberbullying as the use of email, websites, instant messaging, chat rooms, text messaging and digital cameras to antagonize and intimidate others. Disrupting a teleconferencing platform (such as Zoom/Skype/Blackboard Collaborate Ultra) is a federal crime.  </p>
