Collections Data Types:
What are the collection data types in Python?









For each of the collection data types, give an example in Python:
(We've filled in the first one for you):
* sets:  my_set = {1, 31, "Python", 2024, False}






Make a list of the methods for accessing/mutating each collection data type:
(We've filled in the first one for you):
* sets:  
    - in: checks membership
    - len: gives length of the set
    - can take union (&), intersection (|), difference (-), subset (<=)








FOCUS QUESTIONS (Make sure you can answer these questions when you are done with the lab):

Explain what a linter does:




Explain what the following annotations mean:
def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]





What does mutable mean?  Which collection data types are mutable?  Which are immutable?




What is the output of: 
zero = [0]
print(zero*5)
counting = list(range[5])
print(counting.reverse())




What does pop() for the different collection types?
