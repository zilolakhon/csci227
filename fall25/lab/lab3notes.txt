SKELETAL NOTES (follow this template to take notes as you are working through the lab):

Learning Objectives
What are the main learning objectives for this lab?







How do you use "with" to access a file:




What are the three ways to read from a file:




What library and methods were used in Chapter 2 to benchmark (compute the running time) of a function?




For each of the running time complexity bounds, define and give an example:

constant:


linear:


quadratic:



What does "Big O" notation mean?






FOCUS QUESTIONS (Make sure you can answer these questions when you are done with the lab):



Write a function that takes the two file names, and copies the first word of each line of the old file  to the new file:






What is the running time of the below code fragment?  Give your answer in Big O notation:


a = 5
b = 6
c = 10
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        x = i * i
        y = j * j
        z = i * j
for k in range(n):
    w = a * k + 45
    v = b * b
d = 33



What is the running time of the below code fragment?  Give your answer in Big O notation:

for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
      for k in range(n):
         k = 2 + 2


Given the following code fragment, what is its Big O running time?

test = 0
for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
      test = test + i * j
A. O(n)
B. O(n^2)
C. O(log n)
D. O(n^3)


Given the following code fragment what is its Big O running time?

test = 0
for i in range(n):
   test = test + 1

for j in range(n):
   test = test - 1
A. O(n)
B. O(n^2)
C. O(log n)
D. O(n^3)
