<p>All students registered by Wednesday, 26 August are sent a Gradescope registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, write to <code class="inline">ROY.DELGADO63@myhunter.cuny.edu</code>.  Include in your email that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and your EmpID.  We will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it, and we will update the Gradescope registration.</p>

<h3>General Notes</h3>

<p>These program builds on the concepts and code developed during lecture and through the reading.  Mastery of material is assessed via
<ul>
  <li> Autograding of the program submitted to Gradescope, and
  <li> Final exam on the material.  
</ul>

<!--Solutions will be available on Blackboard (<tt>Course Materials : Solutions</tt>) an hour after their respective deadline.
-->

<h4>Autograder Notes</h4>

<p> Submitted code must be in Python, using only the specified libraries.  The autograder expects a <code class="inline">.py</code> file and does not accept iPython notebooks.  Since all assignments are designed to be uploaded as a single file, the autograder is set up for direct file upload instead of Github.  If submitting directly (drop-and-drag onto the webpage), the file name is flexible but must have the extension <code class="inline">.py</code>.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).

<p>To encourage starting early on programs, bonus points are given for early submission.  A bonus, up to 10% of the program grade, are possible.  Programs submitted 48 hours early receive 1 points, prorated by hour.  For example, if you turn in the program 24 hours early, then the bonus poins are: (28 hours/48 hours)*1 points = (1/2)*1 points = 0.5 point.

<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter1870@hunter.cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre></code>
and then followed by his Python program.


<p>Good style accounts for 30% of the program grade.  We are following the standard <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/"target="_blank">PEP 8</a> style guide for Python code.  As part of the autograder scripts, your program is run through a static code analyser (aka a "linter").  
<ul> 
  <li> We are using <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/" target="_blank">Pylint</a> which reports warnings and errors, including message codes, and then scores the code on a scale from 0 to 10.  We multiply your percentage score by 3 (25% of the total) to determine the style grade.  For example, if pylint scores your program 9, your style grade is (9/10) * 2.5 = 2.25</li>   
  <li>See the <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/" target="_blank">Pylint</a> website for tutorials, FAQ's and standard warnings.  </li> 
  <li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP 8</a> specifies that variable names should be at least 3 characters long, but it is long standing convention that DataFrames are named <code class=inline>df</code>.  For the autograders, we have included <code class=inline>df</code> in the "good-names" that are accepted.  This can be done locally with <code class=inline>.pylintrc</code> files or using the command-line option <code class=inline>pylint --good-names=df</code>.</li>
  <li>Most IDE's have linting available:  for example, see <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11084-pylint" target="_blank">pylint in PyCharm</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting" target="_blank">Linting Python in VSCode</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <p><b>Leap Years</b></p>
    <p>	
    Write a function <code class="inline">is_leap()</code> that takes an integer between 1000 and 10,000 and returns <code class="inline">True</code> if it is leap year and <code class="inline">False</code> otherwise.  The following conditions are used to determine leap years:
    <blockquote>
      If the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless the year is divisible by 400.
    </blockquote>
    For example, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1900 and 2100 are not leap years.
  
    <p>Notes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You should submit a file with only the standard comments at the top, the specified functions, and any helper functions you have written. The grading scripts will then import the file for testing.</li>
      <li>If your file includes code outside of functions, either comment the code out before submitting or use a main function that is conditionally executed (see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Think CS: Section 6.8</a> for details).</li>

    Write a function <code class="inline">duplicates()</code> that takes a list of names and returns a list of the names that occur more.  If there are no duplicated names, your function should return an empty list (e.g. <code class="inline">[]</code>)

    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class = "blockcode">names = ['Daniel','Dorothy','Bethany','Beth','Daniel','Georgi']

      <b>Due Date: 5pm, Tuesday, 9 September</b>  <br>
      <b>Reading: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/Introduction/toctree.html">Textbook: Chapter 1</a> & <a href="lab/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

    <p><b>Unique Visitors</b></p> 
    <p>	
    When students visit the lab, their EmpID is stored as an 8-digit string.  Many students visit multiple times, but we are interested in the total number of unique visitors to the lab.  Write a function <code class="inline">unique_visitors()</code> that takes a list of 8-digit strings and returns the number of unique strings that occur.</p>
    
    <p>
    Your function should also screen out any strings that are too long (more than 8 digits) or too short (less than 8 digits) and not include those in the final count returned.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class = "blockcode">ids = ['12345678','11223344','123','12345678']
print(f"The number of unique visitors is {unique_visitors(ids)}.")</code></pre>
  
    would print:
    <pre><code class="datablock">The number of unique visitors is 2.</code></pre>
    since there are 3 entries of the correct length but only 2 unique ones (the first and fourth entries are duplicates of each other).

      <b>Reading: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/Introduction/toctree.html">Textbook: Chapter 1</a> & <a href="lab/lab2.html">Lab 2</a></b><br>

    <p><b>Hexadecimal Plus One</b></p> 

    <p>In <a href="lab/lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, we worked through 
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/">LC 66 (Plus One)</a>, which took a large number, represented as a list of digits and returned its value incremented by one.  For this question, write a function:</p>

    <pre><code class="blockcode">def hex_plus_one(digits: List[str]) -> List[str]:</code></pre>

    <p>that takes a large number stored as a list of hexadecimal digits (the characters from '0','1',...'9','A','B','C','D','E','F' representing the digits 0,1,...9,10,11,12,13,14,15) and returns the large number incremented by 1.</p>

    <p>For example, if the list is <code class="inline">['1','2','F']</code>, then the function should return <code class="inline">['1','3','0']</code> since incrementing the last digit, 'F', by 1 gives 10, or '0' with a carry of 1.  The next to last digit is '2' with the carry becomes '3'.</p>

    <p><b>Longest Words</b></p>    

    <p>Write a program that asks the user for the names of an input file and output file.  Your program should read in the input file and for each line, write the longest word to the output file (if there are more than longest word on a line, the first is written).</p>

    <p>For example, if you ran your program:

    <pre><code class="blockcode">
Enter your input file name:  milne.txt
Enter your output file name:  longest.txt    
    </code>
  </pre>
      
      
  If the input file, <code class="inline">milne.txt</code> contained:</p>

    <pre><code class="datablock">It is more fun to talk 
with someone who doesn't use long, 
difficult words but rather short, 
easy words like 'What about lunch?'

--A.A. Milne</code></pre>

    <p>Then the output file, <code class="inline">output.txt</code>, would contain:</p>

<pre><code class="datablock">more
someone
difficult 
lunch?'
  
--A.A.</code></pre>

  <p>Note:  to simplify this program, words are contiguous characters, separated by spaces (no need to strip off punctuation marks).</p>

    <p><b>Average Grades</b></p>    

    <p>Write a program that asks the user for the names of an input file and output file.  Each line of the input file has a name, followed by grades, separated by spaces.  Your program should read in the input file and for each line, write the name to the output file and the average of the grades, separated by a space.</p>

    <p>For example, if you ran your program:

    <pre><code class="blockcode">Enter your input file name:  grades.txt
Enter your output file name:  ave.txt</code>
  </pre>
      
      
  If the input file, <code class="inline">grades.txt</code> contained:</p>

    <pre><code class="datablock">Amy 10 8 8 4 
Beth 10 11 
Chaaya 10 0 11 9 9 9 
Daiyu 8 8 5 10 10 10
